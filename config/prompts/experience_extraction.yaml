# Experience Extraction Prompts
# Used for LLM-powered extraction of structured work experience data

system_prompt: |
  You are an expert at extracting structured work experience data from resumes.
  Your job is to accurately parse resume text and extract every work experience entry
  with precise dates, company names, titles, locations, and responsibilities.

  Be thorough and accurate:
  - Extract ALL jobs mentioned, even internships or part-time roles
  - Parse dates precisely in YYYY-MM format when possible
  - If only year is provided, use January (YYYY-01) for start and December (YYYY-12) for end
  - Use "Present" for current roles
  - Extract specific responsibilities and achievements
  - Identify the industry based on company and role
  - **DO NOT HALLUCINATE OR INVENT INFORMATION.**
  - **DO NOT USE EXAMPLE DATA.**

  Return ONLY valid JSON - no markdown, no code blocks, no explanations.

extraction_prompt: |
  Extract all work experiences from the following resume text.

  RESUME TEXT:
  {text}

  ## EXTRACTION REQUIREMENTS

  For EACH job/position found in the resume, extract:

  1. **company**: Full company name
  2. **title**: Job title exactly as written
  3. **start_date**: Start date in YYYY-MM format (e.g., "2021-03")
     - If only year given, use YYYY-01
     - If month is written out, convert to number (Jan=01, Feb=02, etc.)
  4. **end_date**: End date in YYYY-MM format OR "Present" if current
     - If only year given, use YYYY-12
  5. **location**: City, State or City, Country if mentioned
  6. **industry**: Industry/sector (Tech, Fintech, Healthcare, E-commerce, etc.)
  7. **responsibilities**: Array of key responsibilities and achievements
     - Extract bullet points as-is
     - Include metrics and numbers where present
     - Limit to top 5 most significant
  8. **is_current**: true if this is the current/most recent active role

  ## DATE PARSING RULES

  Convert these formats to YYYY-MM:
  - "January 2021" -> "2021-01"
  - "Jan 2021" -> "2021-01"
  - "01/2021" -> "2021-01"
  - "2021-01" -> "2021-01"
  - "2021" (only year) -> "2021-01" for start, "2021-12" for end
  - "Present", "Current", "Now" -> "Present"

  ## OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON only)

  {{
    "experiences": [
      {{
        "company": "<company_name>",
        "title": "<job_title>",
        "start_date": "<YYYY-MM>",
        "end_date": "<YYYY-MM or Present>",
        "location": "<City, State>",
        "industry": "<Industry>",
        "responsibilities": [
          "<responsibility_1>",
          "<responsibility_2>"
        ],
        "is_current": <true/false>
      }}
    ]
  }}

  IMPORTANT:
  - Return ALL work experiences found, ordered from most recent to oldest
  - Do not skip any jobs, internships, or contract positions
  - If dates are ambiguous, make reasonable assumptions
  - If no responsibilities are listed, return empty array
  - Ensure all dates are properly formatted

# Alternative prompt for when experience section is already isolated
section_extraction_prompt: |
  Extract structured work experience data from this EXPERIENCE SECTION text.

  EXPERIENCE SECTION:
  {text}

  Parse each job entry and return JSON with the "experiences" array.
  Follow the same format as the main extraction prompt.

  Be especially careful about:
  - Distinguishing between different job entries
  - Correctly associating dates with the right company
  - Not mixing up responsibilities between jobs

# Prompt for validating extracted data
validation_prompt: |
  Review and validate the following extracted work experience data.
  Check for:
  1. Date inconsistencies (overlaps, impossible dates, future dates)
  2. Missing required fields
  3. Logical issues (end date before start date)
  4. Suspiciously short tenures (< 3 months)

  EXTRACTED DATA:
  {data}

  ORIGINAL TEXT:
  {text}

  Return JSON:
  {{
    "is_valid": true/false,
    "issues": ["<issue_1>", "<issue_2>"],
    "corrected_data": {{ "experiences": [...] }}
